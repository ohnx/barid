barid is a simple mail server written in C for Linux. barid is *not* a relaying
server; the intention is for barid to be run on a computer and receive mail
from other Mail Transfer Agents (MTA's).

barid is multi-threaded, can receive secured email using STARTTLS, and fully
supports IPv6. barid can output to standard output or into an Mbox format. Through
the use of modules, barid can deliver to any format you want!

Currently, there are no anti-spam features.
