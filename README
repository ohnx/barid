simple mail server written in C for POSIX. get yourself some mail!

output is stdout (mentions IP and stuff, too) or files in a directory (mbox
format; still WIP). configuration of output is compile-time, sorry! specify the
port to listen on and the domain at runtime, though.

multi-threaded!

TCP is a lot easier to attack compared to UDP. I'm not very good at security so
please don't expect this server to be very secure. please exercise caution and
make good choices!
