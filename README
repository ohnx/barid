barid is a simple mail server written in C for Linux. barid is *not* a relaying
server; the intention is for barid to be run on a computer and receive mail
from other Mail Transfer Agents (MTA's).

barid is multi-threaded, can receive secured email using STARTTLS, supports
checking SPF records to verify senders, and is 100% IPv6-compatible. barid
stores received mails in the Mbox format, but other methods are planned for in
the future(tm).
